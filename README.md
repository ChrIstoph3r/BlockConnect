# BlockConnect

A simple and efficient game, exploiting algorithm knowledge (Y)

Connect as many blocks as possible, by clicking and thereby collapsing smaller connections. 
Ultimately collapse large connections for a large score ;)  

The game provides multiple levels, custom options and a local high score.
